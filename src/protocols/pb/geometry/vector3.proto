 * @brief Represents a 3D vector in free space. Commonly used to represent positions, velocities, or forces. \n
 * This is semantically different from a point. A vector is always anchored at the origin. \n
 * When a transform is applied to a vector, only the rotational component is applied.
 * Provides a simple structure for storing and manipulating 3D vectors.
