# Welcome to AimRT

**AimRT is a runtime development framework for modern robotics.** Built with Modern C++, it is lightweight and easy to deploy, featuring contemporary designs in resource management, asynchronous programming, and deployment configuration.

**AimRT integrates R&D across various deployment scenarios** including robot edge devices, edge computing nodes, and cloud platforms. It serves modern AI-driven and cloud-based robotic applications by providing complete debugging and performance analysis toolchains, along with robust observability support.

**AimRT offers comprehensive plugin development interfaces with high extensibility.** It maintains compatibility with traditional robotics ecosystems (ROS2) and cloud service ecosystems (HTTP, gRPC), while supporting gradual upgrades of existing systems.
